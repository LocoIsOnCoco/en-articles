_What is the benefit of including theÂ "human" in the design of a product. You may have noticed it, but an editorial line, a mascot, functionalities or a sound effect can provoke reactions._

# Emotional Design: Case Studies

This article is not a guide to create, but rather how to be inspired by cases that have succeeded with this type of design. This article will be a case study on different companies: Apple, Coca-Cola and Porsche. These companies are renowned for paying close attention to their designs in order to arouse emotions at the customer.

## Porsche

Why do you think people buy Porsche? These are not the fastest cars nor the most efficient yet it is the sports cars that sell best. Is it a question of price? Yet Porsche is rather expensive when you look at the price of options or even the basic car compared to competitors.

The answer is simple: it's the emotion of buying a Porsche that makes these cars sell. They have an emblematic design of the brand and often allow customers to give themselves a social status.

Indeed owning a Porsche is often much more class than owning a Jaguar F-Type, although it is much cheaper.

Porsche defines it as "the sum of its predecessors. It combines legacy and vision for the future. His silhouette: legendary. Its design: timeless. Its technology: inspired by the most beautiful victories in the race and always pioneering. The 8th generation of the 911 propels us to tomorrow, ahead of its time. "

The Porsche 911 is human-sized, it takes into account all the emotions of the man in his design: beauty, elegance, refinement, everything is there. The brand sees its customers as people, not robots, and that's why it has made a name for itself.

## Coca Cola

Everyone loves Coca-Cola. This article is written with a Coca-Cola in hand. Do you remember your first Coca-Cola? Like most people, you probably have not found that delicious. But you got used to it, and now you love it.

Indeed it is not the taste of Coca-Cola that you appreciate but the image that it refers: the party, fun, sharing, etc.

The iconic red of cans attracts the eye and makes you want to drink. That's why Coca-Cola's design is brilliant. The brand cultivates this image to keep and attract their customers.

The goal of including the customer's emotions in the design is not only to keep customers but to cultivate a brand image as does Coca-Cola. One observes this attitude in all the actions of the brand, until their slogans: "Opens a Coca-Cola, opens happiness. "Choose happiness. "Savor the moment. ".

## Apple

How to forget the masters in this field. Apple does everything to put people at the center of their innovations. It's no mystery if their design system is called "Human Interface Guidelines". They have always tried to make things simpler, more accessible and more humane than they are.

I was not born yet, but Apple was already starting to work on the GUI of computers, so that they are more accessible. They bet the developing billions to make their products more accessible, even to people with disabilities.

Whenever I buy an Apple product we always feel good even if we have spent a fortune in it. I write this on a machine with several hundred or thousands of dollars, whereas a Raspberry Pi would have enough. It is neither the performance nor the characteristics that interests me but the link that I have with this machine. When Steve Jobs insists that the Mac say hello during the keynote is clearly to bind the man to the machine.

It is often claimed that the machine must be transparent and not interfere with the user but it is the opposite that occurs with Apple. They have always wanted the Mac or iPhone to be an extension of ourselves. This is why most people call their "iPhone" phone and "Mac" computers in everyday life.

# How

The emotional design is something difficult to implement this is why networks like Facebook are abandoned by young people to benefit others like Twitter or Instagram. There is no way to create this type of product between art and the human.

You have to think of all the points in their entirety do not focus on some phase of the process of your design but rather see a whole and how people will interact and what they will feel when using your product.

This type of design is not limited to physical products but can perfectly include websites or mobile applications. It is difficult to show emotions in the customer but we must try everything to achieve this end.
